# Proofs and Conjectures

All of these assume a sufficiently large N.  Probably 30 or more.

## Reversal

The reversal of a legal chain is a legal chain
Evident by definition.

## No Big Primes

### Lemma 1

There is at most 1 prime greater than N / 2 in a long chain.
It must be adjacent to 1 which is unique by definition.

### Proof

There are no primes greater than N / 2 in a maximal chain.
Any such prime could be replaced by a prime P less than N / 2 followed by P * 2, thus producing a longer chain.

## Symmetry

### Lemma 1

There is a 1 in a longest chain
If there was no 1 it could be added to either end.

### Lemma 2

The longest chain does not start or end with a 1
If it did a large prime could be added next to it, producing a longer chain.

### Proof

For any maximal chain containing the sequence S1 = a 1 b there is a reversed chain containing sequence S2 = b 1 a
Since any legal chain has a reversed version any maximal chain does as well, the reversed version of S1 is S2.

## Only Primes Next to One (Conjecture)

There is a version of a maximal chain for any N that includes a sequence p1 1 p2 where p1 and p2 are primes.
Handwaving, a maximal sequence may be reordered in the vicinty of 1 to make the closest primes adjacent without shrinking the sequence.
